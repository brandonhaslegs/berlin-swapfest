    <p>
      In association with Berlin's long-time hacker space <a
        href="https://c-base.org">c-base</a
      > we're hosting the first of a quarterly Swapfest at their space in Kreuzberg.
      This is a place to buy, sell, and swap electronics, computer equipment, and
      tools.
    </p>

    <p>
      In tune with the spirit of right-to-repair as well as re-use; the goal of
      the Berlin Swapfest is for people to bring electronics, equipment, and
      tools they no longer use, but want to bring to a good home. If you've been
      trying to find the perfect equipment to build your home-lab or looking for
      new electronic components or tools, this should be the place for you.
    </p>

    <!-- <p>Time-permitting there will be a show-and-tell for vendors to be able to talk about an item they are looking to part with and talk about what they've used it for and any fond memories they have and what they'd hope for someone to gain from purchasing it.</p> -->

  </h1>

  <h2 class="tilt-right">How much does it cost to sell?</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      Being a seller will always be free. Depending on the size of the item
      you're bringing you may be asked for a deposit to handle disposal of your
      items should you not bring it back home with you.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, we highly encourage you to only bring items you're comfortable
      bringing back home with you.
    </p>

    <!-- <p>As an example:</p>
        <p>You've brought a 19" server rack to sell and no one bought it and you're unable to bring it home, the deposit will be used to properly dispose of it.</p> -->
  </div>

  <!-- <h2 class="tilt-left">How large is the space?</h2>
    <div>
        <p>[NEED TO CLARIFY]</p>
    </div> -->

  <h2 class="tilt-left">Do you provide tables?</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      Yes, c-base will provide space and tables for sellers. Space will be
      allocated based on registration information. If you forgot to register as
      a seller, it may be possible to sell items at a table space-permitting.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 class="tilt-right">How can I buy / sell stuff?</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      We have no requirements with how to exchange goods; if you choose to use
      PayPal, Cryptocurrency, or cash, it is entirely up to you. Any disputes
      must be taken up with the seller. Only in the case of a breach of c-base
      rules will a team member step in.
